/**
 * If we start thousands of threads, itâ€™s likely that many of the earlier ones will have finished
 * processing before we have even called start() on the later ones. This could make it difficult to
 * try and reproduce a concurrency problem, as we would not be able to get all our threads to run in
 * parallel. To get around this, Instead of blocking a parent thread until some child threads have
 * finished, we can block each child thread until all the others have started.
